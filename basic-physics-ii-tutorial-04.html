<h2>Question 1 [6 marks]</h2>
<p>
Two identical cells, each of e.m.f. $1.5 \, \text{V}$ and internal resistance $r$, are connected to three identical $6 \, \Omega$ resistors $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$ as shown in Figure 1. If the ammeter reads $1.0 \, \text{A}$, determine the magnitude of the:
- (a) equivalent resistance of the three resistors

For (a), the three $6 \, \Omega$ resistors are in parallel. For (b), use the loop equation. Two cells in parallel give effective emf of $1.5 \, \text{V}$ (same as one cell) but lower internal resistance. Apply $V = \varepsilon - Ir_{\text{eq}}$.
</p>
</details>
<details><summary><strong>Show solution</strong></summary>
<strong>Given:</strong>
<p>
- Two identical cells, each with $\varepsilon = 1.5 \, \text{V}$, internal resistance $r$
- Three $6 \, \Omega$ resistors in parallel
- Ammeter reading: $I = 1.0 \, \text{A}$
</p>

<strong>(a) Equivalent resistance of three $6 \, \Omega$ resistors in parallel:</strong>

<p>
For resistors in parallel:
</p>
$$\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$

$$R_{\text{eq}} = 2 \, \Omega$$

<strong>(b) Internal resistance $r$:</strong>

<p>
Two cells are connected. Based on the diagram:
- Total emf (two cells in series aiding): $\varepsilon_{\text{total}} = 3.0 \, \text{V}$
- Total internal resistance (two cells in series): $r_{\text{total}} = 2r$
</p>

<p>
The external circuit has three $6 \, \Omega$ resistors in parallel = $2 \, \Omega$
</p>

<p>
Using $V = \varepsilon - Ir$:
</p>
$$IR_{\text{eq}} = \varepsilon_{\text{total}} - I(2r)$$

$$(1.0)(2) = 3.0 - 2r$$

$$2 = 3.0 - 2r$$

$$2r = 1.0$$

$$r = 0.5 \, \Omega$$

<p><strong>⚠️ Nuance:</strong> When cells are connected in series, their emfs add. Two $1.5 \, \text{V}$ cells in series give $3.0 \, \text{V}$. Internal resistances also add in series ($2r$). However, if cells were in parallel, emf stays at $1.5 \, \text{V}$ but internal resistance becomes $r/2$.</p>

<h2>Question 2 [5 marks]</h2>
<p>
When a cell (non-ideal emf) supplies $0.20 \, \text{A}$, its terminal voltage is found to be $1.44 \, \text{V}$. When the same cell supplies $0.60 \, \text{A}$, its terminal voltage is $1.32 \, \text{V}$. Compute the cell's terminal voltage when it supplies $1.0 \, \text{A}$.
</p>

<details><summary><strong>Need a hint?</strong></summary>
<p>
For a non-ideal cell, terminal voltage $V = \varepsilon - Ir$, where $\varepsilon$ is the emf and $r$ is internal resistance. You have two data points - use them to find $\varepsilon$ and $r$, then calculate V at 1.0A.
</p>
</details>
<details><summary><strong>Show solution</strong></summary>
<strong>Given:</strong>
<p>
- When $I_1 = 0.20 \, \text{A}$: $V_1 = 1.44 \, \text{V}$
- When $I_2 = 0.60 \, \text{A}$: $V_2 = 1.32 \, \text{V}$
</p>

<strong>Step 1: Find emf and internal resistance</strong>

<p>
The terminal voltage equation: $V = \varepsilon - Ir$
</p>

<p>
For first condition:
</p>
$$1.44 = \varepsilon - 0.20r \quad \text{(1)}$$

<p>
For second condition:
</p>
$$1.32 = \varepsilon - 0.60r \quad \text{(2)}$$

<p>
Subtract (2) from (1):
</p>
$$1.44 - 1.32 = -0.20r + 0.60r$$

$$0.12 = 0.40r$$

$$r = 0.30 \, \Omega$$

<p>
Substitute back into (1):
</p>
$$1.44 = \varepsilon - 0.20(0.30)$$

$$1.44 = \varepsilon - 0.06$$

$$\varepsilon = 1.50 \, \text{V}$$

<strong>Step 2: Find terminal voltage at $I = 1.0 \, \text{A}$</strong>

$$V = \varepsilon - Ir = 1.50 - 1.0(0.30) = 1.50 - 0.30 = 1.20 \, \text{V}$$

<p><strong>⚠️ Nuance:</strong> This is a classic problem of determining internal resistance. The emf ($\varepsilon$) is the "ideal" voltage when no current flows (open circuit). Terminal voltage drops linearly as current increases due to internal resistance. The slope of the V-I graph gives $-r$.</p>

<h2>Question 3 [5 marks]</h2>
<p>
Based on the circuit shown in Figure 3, calculate the potential difference between points A and B. (Assume that internal resistance is negligible/the emf is ideal)

<p>
This is a circuit with two resistors in parallel (5Ω and 20Ω), connected to a 10V source. Find the equivalent resistance, then use Ohm's law to find the current. Finally, find the voltage at point B relative to A.
</p>
</details>
<details><summary><strong>Show solution</strong></summary>
<strong>Given:</strong> 10V source with $5 \, \Omega$ and $20 \, \Omega$ resistors in parallel.

<strong>Step 1: Find equivalent resistance</strong>
$$\frac{1}{R_p} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{20} = \frac{4}{20} + \frac{1}{20} = \frac{5}{20} = \frac{1}{4}$$

$$R_p = 4 \, \Omega$$

<strong>Step 2: Find current from source</strong>
$$I = \frac{V}{R_p} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \, \text{A}$$

<strong>Step 3: Find voltage at point B (relative to negative terminal)</strong>

<p>
The voltage at point A (where resistors connect to positive terminal) is 10V.
The voltage at point B is 0V (negative terminal).
</p>

<p>
So: $V_A - V_B = 10 - 0 = 10\,$V
</p>

<p>
Wait - looking at the solution more carefully. Let me recalculate.
</p>

<p>
Actually, in a parallel circuit, the voltage across each branch is the same as the source voltage. So $V_A = 10\,$V (at positive terminal), $V_B = 0\,$V (at negative terminal).
</p>

$$V_{AB} = V_A - V_B = 10 - 0 = 10 \, \text{V}$$

<p><strong>⚠️ Nuance:</strong> For resistors in parallel, the voltage across each resistor is the same (equal to the source voltage). The current divides inversely proportional to resistance - the smaller resistor (5Ω) gets more current. The equivalent resistance is always less than the smallest individual resistor.</p>

<p>
For (a): KJR states that sum of currents entering a junction = sum leaving. For (b) and (c): KLR states that sum of potential changes around any closed loop = 0. Be careful with sign conventions - going from - to + through a battery is a voltage rise (+ε), going from + to - is a voltage drop (-ε). Going through a resistor in direction of current is a voltage drop (-IR).

<strong>Given:</strong> Circuit with $6 \, \Omega$, $3 \, \Omega$, $9 \, \Omega$ resistors, $15 \, \text{V}$ and $12 \, \text{V}$ sources.

<strong>(a) Kirchhoff Junction Rule at node B:</strong>

<p>
Currents $I_1$ and $I_2$ flow into node B, current $I_3$ flows out:
</p>
$$I_1 + I_2 = I_3$$

<p>
Or equivalently:
</p>
$$I_1 + I_2 - I_3 = 0$$

<strong>(b) Kirchhoff Loop Rule for Loop 1 (L1): FABEF</strong>

<p>
Starting from point F, going through A→B→E→F:
- From F to A through $15 \, \text{V}$ source (negative to positive): $+15 \, \text{V}$
- From A to B through $6 \, \Omega$ resistor (in direction of $I_1$): $-6I_1$
- From B to E through $3 \, \Omega$ resistor (in direction of $I_3$): $-3I_3$
- From E to F through $12 \, \text{V}$ source (positive to negative): $-12 \, \text{V}$
</p>

<p>
Sum around the loop:
</p>
$$15 - 6I_1 - 3I_3 - 12 = 0$$

$$3 - 6I_1 - 3I_3 = 0$$

<p>
Or:
</p>
$$2I_1 + I_3 = 1 \quad \text{(Equation L1)}$$

<strong>(c) Kirchhoff Loop Rule for Loop 2 (L2): BCDEB</strong>

<p>
Starting from B, going through C→D→E→B:
- From B to D through $9 \, \Omega$ resistor (in direction of $I_2$): $-9I_2$
- From D to E through $12 \, \text{V}$ source (positive to negative): $-12 \, \text{V}$
- From E to B through $3 \, \Omega$ resistor (opposite to $I_3$): $+3I_3$
</p>

<p>
Sum around the loop:
</p>
$$-9I_2 - 12 + 3I_3 = 0$$

<p>
Or:
</p>
$$3I_3 - 9I_2 = 12$$

$$I_3 - 3I_2 = 4 \quad \text{(Equation L2)}$$

<p><strong>⚠️ Nuance:</strong> When applying KLR, choose a consistent direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) for each loop. If you go through a component in the direction of assumed current, the voltage drop is $-IR$. If against the current, it's $+IR$. For batteries, going from negative to positive terminal gives $+\varepsilon$.</p>

<h2>Question 5 [6 marks]</h2>
<p>
Based on Figure 5, determine:
- (a) the magnitude for currents $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$
- (b) which current direction is wrongly chosen and state the correct direction
</p>

<details><summary><strong>Need a hint?</strong></summary>
<p>
Use the three equations from Q4:
1. $I_1 + I_2 = I_3$ (Junction rule at B)
2. $2I_1 + I_3 = 1$ (Loop 1)
3. $I_3 - 3I_2 = 4$ (Loop 2)
</p>

<p>
Solve these three equations simultaneously. If a current comes out negative, the actual direction is opposite to what was assumed.
</p>
</details>
<details><summary><strong>Show solution</strong></summary>
<strong>Using the equations from Q4:</strong>

<p>
1. Junction rule at B: $I_1 + I_2 = I_3$
2. Loop 1: $2I_1 + I_3 = 1$
3. Loop 2: $I_3 - 3I_2 = 4$
</p>

<strong>Step 1: Express $I_3$ from equation 1:</strong>
$$I_3 = I_1 + I_2$$

<strong>Step 2: Substitute into equation 2:</strong>
$$2I_1 + (I_1 + I_2) = 1$$
$$3I_1 + I_2 = 1 \quad \text{(4)}$$

<strong>Step 3: Substitute into equation 3:</strong>
$$(I_1 + I_2) - 3I_2 = 4$$
$$I_1 - 2I_2 = 4 \quad \text{(5)}$$

<strong>Step 4: Solve equations (4) and (5):</strong>

<p>
From (4): $I_2 = 1 - 3I_1$
</p>

<p>
Substitute into (5):
</p>
$$I_1 - 2(1 - 3I_1) = 4$$
$$I_1 - 2 + 6I_1 = 4$$
$$7I_1 = 6$$
$$I_1 = \frac{6}{7} = 0.857 \, \text{A}$$

<p>
Then:
</p>
$$I_2 = 1 - 3(0.857) = 1 - 2.571 = -1.571 \, \text{A}$$

<p>
And:
</p>
$$I_3 = I_1 + I_2 = 0.857 + (-1.571) = -0.714 \, \text{A}$$

<strong>(a) Magnitudes:</strong>
<p>
- $I_1 = 0.857 \, \text{A}$
- $I_2 = 1.571 \, \text{A}$
- $I_3 = 0.714 \, \text{A}$
</p>

<strong>(b) Wrong directions:</strong>
<p>
- $I_2$ is negative: actual direction is from B to C (opposite to assumed)
- $I_3$ is negative: actual direction is from E to B (opposite to assumed)
</p>

<p>
Correct directions:
- $I_1$: From F to A (as assumed) = $0.857 \, \text{A}$
- $I_2$: From B to D (opposite to assumed) = $1.571 \, \text{A}$
- $I_3$: From E to B (opposite to assumed) = $0.714 \, \text{A}$
</p>

<p><strong>⚠️ Nuance:</strong> A negative current in the solution simply means the actual current flows in the opposite direction to what was initially assumed. This is perfectly fine - the magnitude tells you how strong the current is, and the sign tells you the direction. This often happens when you have multiple voltage sources and the "smaller" one actually gets charged by the "larger" one.</p>

<h2>Common Patterns</h2>

<strong>Resistor Combinations:</strong>
<p>
- Series: $R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$
- Parallel: $\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}$
</p>

<strong>EMF and Terminal Voltage:</strong>
<p>
- $V = \varepsilon - Ir$ (for a cell with internal resistance)
- EMF ($\varepsilon$) is the open-circuit voltage
</p>

<strong>Kirchhoff's Laws:</strong>
<p>
- Junction Rule: $\sum I_{\text{in}} = \sum I_{\text{out}}$
- Loop Rule: $\sum V = 0$ around any closed loop
</p>

<strong>Sign Conventions for KLR:</strong>
<p>
- Through resistor in direction of current: $\Delta V = -IR$
- Through resistor against current: $\Delta V = +IR$
- Through battery from negative to positive: $\Delta V = +\varepsilon$
- Through battery from positive to negative: $\Delta V = -\varepsilon$
</p>

<strong>Solving Circuit Problems:</strong>
<p>
1. Label currents $I_1, I_2, I_3$ with arbitrary directions
2. Apply Junction Rule at each junction
3. Apply Loop Rule for independent loops
4. Solve the simultaneous equations
5. Negative current means actual direction is opposite
